# Pokedex-Angular-App
Creating the Pokedex from scratch to account for all 807 varieties of fictitious beasts is a hell of a challenge especially when you consider adding species to account for future generations.  With the help of the PokeAPI.co, an Angular FE will be built on top of the PokeAPI.co's JSON file to display attributes of each Pokemon and allow users to add Pokemon as they like as long as the SPA persists w/o a page reload.
